# Introduction

A Quadcopter is a helicopter with four rotors. A rotor is the main rotating part of an electrical machine such as a propeller blade. The rotors provide lift and propulsion for the quadcopter via electromechanical energy conversion. 

There are three dimensions in which a flying object can move through: pitch, yaw, and roll.

Pitch refers to moving the nose of an aircraft up and down.
Yaw refers to moving the nose of an aircraft left and right.
Roll refers to tilting (rolling) an aircraft side to side.
